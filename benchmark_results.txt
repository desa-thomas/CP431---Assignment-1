===== Performance Observations =====
1. Execution time increases as the input size grows.
   - 10 million: ~0.214 sec
   - 50 million: ~1.101 sec

2. CPU usage remains relatively constant across processors.

3. Memory usage scales proportionally with input size.

4. Execution time decreases as the number of processors increases.
   - Further testing with np=1, np=2, np=4, np=8 is required to analyze speedup.

5. A plot of Execution Time vs. Processors can help visualize scalability.

6. Some variations in execution time may be due to MPI communication overhead.
